rem
rem  This script performs activities after a simulator build to run 
rem  simulator specific test activities.  
rem  The test activities performed include:
rem   1) a sanity check on the simh REGister definitions for each
rem      device in the simulator.  If the register sanity check fails, 
rem      the build fails and the simulator binary is deleted - since 
rem      this failure is akin to a compile time error the simulator 
rem      should be fixed before it can be used.
rem   2) An optional simulator test which is only performed
rem      if a simulation test script is available.
rem   3) An optional source code analysis to verify project standards
rem      have been followed.
rem
rem  There are 2 required parameters to this procedure:
rem    1 - The simulator source directory
rem    2   The compiled simulator binary path
rem  There are 2 optional parameters to this procedure:
rem    3   A specific test script name
rem    4   Optional parameters to invoke the specified script with
rem
rem  These tests will be skipped if there is a file named Post-Build-Event.Skip
rem  in the same directory as this procedure.
rem
rem  The source code analysis is only run if there is a file named 
rem  Post-Build-Event.Run-Source-Check in the same directory as this procedure.
rem  When source code analysis is being run, the existence of a file named 
rem  Post-Build-Event.Run-Source-Check-Switches will cause detailed analysis
rem  information to be emitted for all files analyzed.
